## 1) Population + Affordability + Scarcity → Growth

**Anecdotal idea:** Markets grow where population inflows meet affordability
and lifestyle scarcity (beach proximity, commute).

**Simulation logic:**  
- Increase appreciation probability when population growth + affordability +
  scarcity index exceed thresholds.

**NPC behavior:**  
- "Lifestyle‑seeking" NPCs overweight coastal / transit‑accessible suburbs.

---

## 2) Price Ceiling → Demand Shifts to Smaller Dwellings

**Anecdotal idea:** Once median prices exceed income multiples, buyers
compromise (houses → townhouses → units).

**Simulation logic:**  
- When price-to-income exceeds threshold, reduce house demand and increase
  townhouse/unit demand.

**UI explainer:**  
- "Affordability ceiling triggers dwelling‑type substitution."

---

## 3) Rent Growth Lulls after Rapid Price Growth

**Anecdotal idea:** After sharp price/rent rises, rents can stagnate briefly,
then resume growth.

**Simulation logic:**  
- After a boom phase, insert a short “rent plateau” period before recovery.

**NPC behavior:**  
- Yield‑focused NPCs pause buying during yield compression.

---

## 4) Land Release ≠ Always Negative

**Anecdotal idea:** New supply can still support growth if demand and
demographics are strong (families building for themselves).

**Simulation logic:**  
- Supply shocks reduce short‑term growth but may raise long‑term baseline if
  demand index remains elevated.

---

## 5) Investor Psychology (Fear vs Early Entry)

**Anecdotal idea:** Many investors wait for proof and miss early growth;
early entrants take higher perceived risk.

**Simulation logic:**  
- Add “fearful investor” NPCs that enter late after momentum thresholds.
- Add “early mover” NPCs that enter during early‑signal phases.

---

## 6) Coastal Lifestyle Premium (WA)

**Anecdotal idea:** Coastal proximity and commute access create a persistent
premium in Perth relative to other suburbs.

**Simulation logic:**  
- Add a “coastal premium” multiplier with slow‑decay over time.

## Notes

- These themes are **not empirical data**.
- Use them to drive **storylines, NPC personas, and explainers**.
- Anchor numeric values to official sources when presenting metrics.
